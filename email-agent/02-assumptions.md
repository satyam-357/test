# 2. Assumptions

This section documents the technical and business assumptions made during the design and implementation of the Email Agent microservice.

## 2.1 Technical Assumptions

### Platform and Runtime Assumptions

2. **Database Integration**: MariaDB 10.6+ for data persistence with JPA/Hibernate
3. **Maven Dependency Management**: Maven 3.8+ for dependency resolution and artifact building
4. **Memory Management**: Sufficient heap memory for Microsoft Graph API responses and calendar data caching
5. **Thread Safety**: Concurrent access to cached tokens and user preferences is handled safely
6. **Docker Support**: Application runs in containerized environment with proper resource allocation

### External API Assumptions
1. **Microsoft Graph API**: Microsoft Graph API maintains stable endpoints and authentication mechanisms
2. **Exchange Web Services**: EWS API remains available for legacy Exchange server integration
3. **API Rate Limits**: Microsoft Graph and EWS have sufficient rate limits for expected usage patterns
4. **Authentication Tokens**: OAuth 2.0 tokens are properly managed and refreshed automatically
5. **API Consistency**: Microsoft APIs maintain consistent response formats and error handling
6. **Zoom Integration**: Zoom API remains stable for meeting creation and management

### Configuration Assumptions
1. **Mandatory Configuration**: Database connection, Microsoft Graph credentials, and EWS settings are required
2. **Environment Variables**: All sensitive configuration is provided via environment variables
3. **Network Connectivity**: Stable network connectivity to Microsoft Graph, EWS, and Zoom APIs
4. **Timezone Support**: System timezone configuration is properly set for accurate time calculations
5. **SSL/TLS**: All external API communications use secure HTTPS connections

## 2.2 Integration Assumptions

### Microsoft Graph Integration
1. **Service Availability**: Microsoft Graph API is running and accessible via HTTPS
2. **API Compatibility**: Microsoft Graph APIs maintain backward compatibility across versions
3. **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 access tokens are properly managed and refreshed
4. **Permissions**: Required Microsoft Graph permissions are granted for calendar and user management
5. **Rate Limiting**: Microsoft Graph rate limits are sufficient for expected usage patterns
6. **Data Consistency**: Calendar and user data remain consistent across API calls

### Exchange Web Services Integration
1. **EWS Availability**: Exchange Web Services are available and accessible
2. **Service Account**: EWS service account has sufficient permissions for calendar operations
3. **Authentication**: Basic authentication or modern authentication works reliably
4. **API Compatibility**: EWS API maintains compatibility with supported Exchange versions
5. **Network Access**: EWS endpoints are accessible from the application environment

### Spring Boot Integration
1. **Auto-Configuration**: Spring Boot auto-configuration works correctly with JPA and web components
2. **Component Scanning**: All application components are properly scanned and initialized
3. **Bean Lifecycle**: Service beans are properly initialized and destroyed
4. **Dependency Injection**: All required dependencies are available in the Spring context
5. **Transaction Management**: JPA transactions are properly managed for data consistency

### External Service Dependencies
1. **Database Availability**: MariaDB is available and accessible for data persistence
2. **Network Latency**: Acceptable network latency for external API calls (Microsoft Graph, EWS, Zoom)
3. **Service Discovery**: External services are discoverable via configured URLs
4. **DNS Resolution**: Proper DNS resolution for all external service endpoints

## 2.3 Performance Assumptions

### Caching and Memory
1. **Memory Usage**: Cached tokens, user preferences, and calendar data fit within available JVM memory
2. **Cache Hit Ratio**: High cache hit ratio for frequently accessed user preferences and tokens
3. **Memory Cleanup**: Garbage collection handles memory cleanup efficiently
4. **Concurrent Access**: Thread-safe access to cached data structures and shared resources

### Response Time Assumptions
1. **Calendar Operations**: Calendar operations complete within acceptable response times
2. **Meeting Scheduling**: Meeting creation and scheduling complete within reasonable timeframes
3. **Availability Checking**: Availability checks complete efficiently
4. **User Management**: User creation and license assignment complete within expected timeframes
5. **Token Refresh**: Token refresh operations complete within configured timeouts

### Scalability Assumptions
1. **Concurrent Users**: System supports multiple concurrent users across organizations
2. **Throughput**: System handles expected calendar operations per second during peak load
3. **Resource Scaling**: Memory and CPU resources can be scaled as needed
4. **Database Performance**: Database operations perform within acceptable limits under load
5. **API Rate Limits**: External API rate limits support expected usage patterns

### Error Handling Assumptions
1. **Retry Logic**: Retry mechanisms handle transient failures effectively for external APIs
2. **Fallback Support**: Fallback between Microsoft Graph and EWS works reliably
3. **Graceful Degradation**: System degrades gracefully under high load or API unavailability
4. **Error Recovery**: Automatic recovery from common error conditions (token expiry, network issues)
5. **Circuit Breaker**: Circuit breaker patterns prevent cascade failures

## 2.4 Implementation Assumptions

### Data Model Assumptions
1. **JPA Entity Design**: EmailUser and EmailPreferences entities support required operations
2. **Database Schema**: MariaDB schema supports multi-tenant operations with proper indexing
3. **Soft Deletes**: EmailUser entity uses boolean deleted flag for soft delete operations
4. **Timezone Storage**: EmailPreferences stores timezone as string with proper validation
5. **Working Hours**: Checkin/checkout times stored as LocalTime for working hours calculation

### API Integration Assumptions
1. **Microsoft Graph API**: Stable endpoints and consistent response formats
2. **EWS API**: Legacy Exchange server compatibility maintained
3. **Zoom API**: Meeting creation and management APIs remain stable
4. **Rate Limiting**: External APIs have sufficient rate limits for expected usage
5. **Authentication**: OAuth 2.0 tokens can be refreshed automatically

### Performance Assumptions
1. **Memory Usage**: JVM heap sufficient for token caching and calendar data
2. **Database Performance**: MariaDB queries perform within acceptable response times
3. **Network Latency**: External API calls complete within configured timeouts
4. **Concurrent Access**: Thread-safe operations for shared resources
5. **Caching Strategy**: In-memory caching provides adequate performance improvement
